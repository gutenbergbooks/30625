<center>No. X.&mdash;TOMMY AND HIS SISTER JANE.</center>

<p>Once more we draw upon our favourite source of inspiration&mdash;the poems of
the Misses <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The dramatist is serenely confident that the new
London County Council Censor of Plays, whenever that much-desired
official is appointed, will highly approve of this little piece on
account of the multiplicity of its morals. It is intended to teach,
amongst other useful lessons, that&mdash;as the poem on which it is founded
puts it&mdash;"Fruit in lanes is seldom good"; also, that it is not always
prudent to take a hint; again, that constructive murder is distinctly
reprehensible, and should never be indulged in by persons who cannot
control their countenances afterwards. Lastly, that suicide may often be
averted by the exercise of a little <i>savoir vivre.</i></p>

<center><span class="smcap">Characters.</span></center>

<p><i>Tommy and his Sister Jane (Taylorian Twins, and awful examples).</i></p>

<p><i>Their Wicked Uncle (plagiarised from a forgotten Nursery Story, and
slightly altered).</i></p>

<p><i>Old Farmer Copeer (skilled in the use of horse and cattle medicines).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A shady lane; on the right, a gate, leading to the farm; left,
some bushes, covered with practicable scarlet berries.</i></p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr, Punch's Own Type-writer.</i>)<br /><br />

No. X.&mdash;THE MARTYR <i>INCOMPRISE</i>.</center>

<div class="figright" style="width: 30%">
<a href="images/208.png">
<img src="images/208.png" width="100%" alt="cartoon" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Martyr <i>Incomprise</i> is one who, having in her home erected a stake,
ties to it her husband, and then having set alight the faggots which her
own hands have piled round him, calls the world to witness the
saint-like fortitude with which she bears up under the sufferings
inflicted upon her by her lord and master. She will have been married to
a man who, though he does not pretend to be above the ordinary frailties
and failings of human nature, tries honestly, for many years, to make
her happy. Time after time does this domestic Sisyphus roll the stone of
contentment up the hill of his wife's temper, and time after time does
it slip from his hands, and go clattering down into the plain of
despair. The Martyr is a very virtuous lady, yet she is not satisfied
with the calm and acknowledged possession of her virtues. She adds them
to her armoury of aggravation, and uses them with a deadly effect. Her
morality is irreproachable. She studies to make it a reproach to her
husband, and, inasmuch as her temper is equally compounded of the most
persistent obstinacy, and the most perverse and unaccountable caprices,
it is unnecessary to say that she succeeds marvellously in her
undertaking.</p>

<p>As a girl, the Martyr will have been distinguished by a keen sense of
wrong, and a total lack of all sense of humour. Having been rebuked by
her mother for some trifling fault, she will persuade herself that her
parents detest her, and desire her death. She will spend the next few
days with her breast luxuriously against the thorn of her fancied
sufferings. She will weave romances, in order to enjoy the delicious
sensation of looking on as she withers under injustice into a premature
coffin, and of watching her cruel parents as they water the grave of
their victim with unavailing tears. A somewhat lax method of bringing up
will have enabled her to read many trashy novels. Out of these she
constructs an imaginary hero, all gushing tenderness and a tawny
moustache. Having met a young man who fully realises her ideal in the
latter particular, she promptly assumes his possession of the former,
and accepts his proposal of marriage. After having all but thrown him
over on three or four occasions for an insufficient display of romantic
devotion at dances and tennis parties, she eventually marries him. Soon
afterwards she discovers that he is not a chivalrous wind-bag, but a
Man, whereupon she shatters his pedestal, and abandons herself to misery
amidst the ruins.</p>

<p>And now the full joys of her married martyrdom begin. She withdraws even
from the affectation of interest in her partner, his friends and his
pursuits. She spends her mornings in the keeping of a diary, or the
writing of a novel, in which she appoints herself to the post of
heroine, and endows her creation with a superhuman combination of
unappreciated qualities. From the fact that her husband spends a large
part of each day away from her, either in attending to his business or
in following a sport, she infers that he has ceased to love her. When he
returns in the evening, she locks herself into her room, and, having
thus assured to herself solitude, she converts it, by an easy process,
into the studied neglect of an unfeeling husband.</p>

<p>She now gathers round herself a select company of two or three female
friends, whom the easy good-nature of her husband permits to stay in his
house for months at a time. Into their sympathetic ears she pours the
story of her woes, and gradually organises them into a trained band of
disciplined conspirators, who make it their constant object to defend
the wife by thwarting the husband. They have their signs and their
pass-words. If the callous male, for the enjoyment of whose hospitality
they seem to gain an additional zest by affecting to despise and defy
him, should intimate at the dinner-table that he has ventured to make
some arrangement without consulting them, they will raise their
eyebrows, and look pityingly at the wife. She will inform them, in a
tone of convinced melancholy, that she has long suspected that she was
of no importance to any one, but that now she knows it for certain. She
will then tell her husband that, as she is no longer allowed to interest
herself in what he does, she has of course no opinion on the matter in
hand, and that, if she had one, she would never think of offering it
when she knows that all interference on her part is always so bitterly
resented. Her husband's temper having exploded in the orthodox marital
manner, she will smile sweetly upon him, and, the butler and footman
having entered with the fish, will implore him, in a voice intended
rather for the servants than for him, to moderate his anger, lest he
should set a bad example. She will then weep silently into her tumbler,
and her friends, after expressing a muttered indignation at the
heartlessness of men, will support her tottering steps from the room. If
her husband should invite one or two of his friends to dinner on a
subsequent occasion, she will amuse herself and madden him by recounting
to them this incident, in which she will figure as a suffering angel,
whose wings have moulted under the neglect and cruel treatment of an
unangelic spouse. If, while her story is in progress, she should observe
her husband writhing, she will inform him that she is sure he must be
sitting in a draught, and will order the butler to place a screen behind
him. Having thus called attention to his discomfort, and to the care
with which she watches over him, she will take offence when he
countermands the screen; and, after giving the company in general to
understand that she is not allowed to give orders in her own house, she
will, for the rest of the evening, preserve a death-like calm. This will
be followed, on the departure of her guests, by showers of tears and
reproaches, the inevitable prelude to twenty-four hours of salts and
seclusion in the privacy of her bed-room. It is curious to note that,
although the Martyr, at an early period of her married life, developes a
distaste for going into society, which she attributes to the persecution
of her husband; yet she always contrives to spend as much money as those
who live in a whirl of gaiety. Her bills, therefore, mount up, and, in a
moment of unguarded pecuniary prudence, her husband will remonstrate
mildly with her upon her extravagance. She will, thereupon, accuse him
to her friends of meanness, and avow her determination never again to
ask him for money. For a short time she will pay portions of her own
bills, but, finding her pin-money insufficient for the purpose, she will
sell some jewels, and spend the proceeds on a new tea-gown. Her
increasing liabilities will afford her no anxiety, seeing that her sense
of martyrdom increases in proportion, and that in her heart of hearts
she knows that her husband is prepared to pay everything, and will
eventually have to do so.</p>

<p>After some years of this life her husband will have acquired the
reputation of a domestic ruffian. Friends will shake their heads, and
wonder how long his sweet wife will bear up against his treatment. It
will be reported, on the authority of imaginary eye-witnesses, that he
has thrown a soup-plate at her, and that, on more than one occasion, he
has beaten her. He will find himself shunned, and will be driven for
society and pleasure to his bachelor haunts. His wife will now rage with
jealousy over a defection she has done her best to cause. After a time
she will hire the services of a detective, and will file a petition in
the Divorce Court. The case will probably be undefended, and the Court
having listened to her tale of cruelty, the imaginative boldness of
which will startle even the friend who corroborates it in the
witness-box, will decree to her a divorce from the supposed author of
her sufferings. She will then set up for a short time as an object of
universal pity, but, meeting a bluff and burly widower, she will accept
him as her second husband. After having wearied of her constant recital
of her former misery, this husband will begin to neglect and ill-use her
in good earnest. Under the tonic of this genuine shock, her spirits may
revive; and it is as likely as not that she will enjoy many years of
mitigated happiness as the wife of a real tyrant.</p>

<h2>TIPS FROM THE TAPE.</h2>

<center>(<i>Picked up in Mr. Punch's Own Special City Corner.</i>)</center>

<p>EVER since it became known that, in conformity with the general interest
in the condition of the Stock and Share Market, now manifested by all
classes of readers, you had determined to start your own special
"Corner," for the purpose of keeping your eye on the matter, and had
appointed me as your "City Commissioner," if I have been flooded with
applications from Stock-jobbers, tendering their advice, I may say I
have been literally overwhelmed by applications from clients and
outsiders, asking me for mine. With five tapes always on the move,
telephonic communication with everywhere, and my telegraphic address of
"Panjimcracks," comfortably installed in a third-floor flat in
commanding premises, within a stone's throw of the Stock Exchange, I
flatter myself that, at least in all the surroundings of my position, I
am, acting under your instructions, well up to the mark.</p>

<p>You would wish naturally to know something of the state of the market,
and would doubtless like to hear from me, if there is any particular
investment that I can recommend as safe for a rise. I have been giving
some attention lately to</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Patagonian Crocodiles</span>,</center>

<p>but from news that has reached me from a private and most reliable
source (I hear that the Chairman and Directors, who have gone off with
the balance-sheet have disappeared, and have not been heard of for
months) I should strongly advise, if you hold any of it, to get rid of
it, if you can, as soon as possible. I have a similar tale to tell about</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Hernebay Z's</span>.</center>

<p>This Stock has been run up by purchasers for the fall; and, though in
October last it somehow touched 117-3/8, it is now standing at 9-1/4,
and, spite the rumours of increased traffic receipts (due to the fact
that a family drove up to the station last week in a cab), artfully put
into circulation by interested holders, I would certainly get out of it
before the issue of the forthcoming Report, which I hear, on good
authority, not only announces the payment of no dividend on the
Debenture Stock, but makes the unwelcome statement to the shareholders
of the prospective seizure of the whole of the rolling stock under a
debtors' summons, a catastrophe that must land the affairs of the
Company in inevitable bankruptcy. Under these circumstances, I do not
think I can conscientiously advise you to "hold;" still, you might watch
the Market for a day or two; but, at any rate, take my advice, and get
rid of your "Crocodiles."</p>

<center>I subjoin some of my correspondence:&mdash;</center>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am in the somewhat embarrassing position of being
responsible for &pound;5000 under the marriage settlement of a niece,
that, owing to my want of financial knowledge, has, I fear, been
somewhat injudiciously, if not absolutely, illegally invested by my
Co-Trustee. Though the settlement stipulates that only Government
Stocks and Railway Debentures are available, I find that the money
at the present moment is thus disposed  of:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

</table>

<p>You see it is not so much the depreciated value of the Securities, which
certainly read well, but the absence of the Dividend which perplexes me.
What would be your advice? Should I sell, or continue to hold?</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">A Puzzled Trustee</span>.</p>

<p>We should certainly hold.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Acting on the advice of a friend who is in the Directorate, I
have largely invested in the Automatic Hair-cutting Company. Owing,
however, to the fact that customers, who will not hold their heads
properly, have on several occasions latterly had their ears trimmed,
and a pattern cut on their necks, several actions for heavy damages
have been brought against the concern. These having been successful
in every case, the Company is virtually ruined, and the shares are,
in consequence, almost unsaleable. What should I do with mine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">An Anxious Speculator</span>.</p>

<p>Hold. The Company has evidently touched bottom. Wait for the rise.</p>

<p>You will see from the above specimens, taken at random from a heap of
others, that I utterly deprecate panic. "Never cut losses" is the
wholesome and cheerful advice I give all my clients. There cannot be a
doubt about it being thoroughly sound; for it stands to reason if no one
were to sell out, no securities would ever fall. So, to nine out of ten
who ask my advice I invariably say, "Hold." Though I have several stocks
in prospective, the movements of which I am watching most attentively, I
have, I confess, hardly got things into proper working order yet, but I
have a grand scheme on foot that will, I fancy, take the wind out of the
sails of many hitherto successful Stockdealers. In my new system
three-and-sixpence will cover &pound;500! Here will be a chance for even the
schoolboy to taste the delights of Monte Carlo. But more of this later.
Suffice it to say, that I have a "Combination Pool" in my eye, that if I
can only carry out with the right sort of stock, ought to make the
fortune of every one concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Theatrical Short Service Bill.&mdash;Charles the Second (Wyndham)</span> is
following in the footsteps of <span class="smcap">Charles the First (Mathews)</span> and beginning
to play several short pieces as one entertainment, instead of giving a
three-act farce or comedy, and one brief and unimportant curtain-raiser.
At least, he is <i>Trying It On</i>. How far preferable, in the summer and
autumn season, would be an evening bill of fare consisting of three
<i>entr&eacute;es</i>, each of a different character, and all of first-rate quality.
The patron of the drama could pick and choose, and be satisfied with an
hour, or two hours, or three hours' entertainment. How much better for
the actor's art, too, by way of varying his <i>r&ocirc;les</i>. The stall people
would rather pay the present price of half a guinea for anything,
however short, which it was the fashion to see, than for a long piece
which only bores them. To see short pieces, they might come two or three
times instead of once, and the management could make a reduction on
taking a quantity.</p>

<p>There is a small fortune waiting for this <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, or t'other
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>, 'yclept <span class="smcap">Hawtrey</span>, whichever may take up the idea and work it.</p>

<p class="i0">That is useful work well done, and it hasn't been all fun,</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE</h2>

<p>In his <i>By Order of the Czar</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Hatton</span> exposes the cruelties of
Muscovite rule in the most trenchant yet entertaining fashion. The
headings to the chapters (to say nothing of their contents) are exciting
to a degree, and consequently it is not altogether surprising that the
Russian officials, possibly hearing that the three handsome volumes
might cause a revolution, should have refused them admission to the
Emperor's dominions. Be this as it may, in each of the aforesaid
handsome volumes appears a slip of yellow paper, announcing that "it is
prohibited by the Government of the <span class="smcap">Czar</span> from circulation in Russia."
How fortunate&mdash;not, of course, for the Russians, poor things, to be
deprived of this treat&mdash;but how fortunate that it is not prohibited
<i>here</i>! With Mr. <span class="smcap">Joseph Hatton</span> continuously in his thoughts, the <span class="smcap">Baron</span>
has sung ever since&mdash;not only "<i>In the Gloaming</i>," be it understood, but
during the following day, and well into the succeeding night&mdash;"<i>Best</i>
for him (J. H), <i>and best</i> for me (<span class="smcap">B. de B. W.</span>)." The novel should have
a large general circulation, in spite of the boycotting to which it has
been locally subjected in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Siberia.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Jeanie Middlemass</span> has made a step in the right direction by
publishing <i>Two False Moves</i>. Like all her work, the new novel is deeply
interesting. As it is full of "go," it is sure to be continually on the
march in the circulating libraries.</p>

<p>In <i>Miss Mephistopheles</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Feargus Hume</span> gives us a story much in
advance of <i>The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</i>. It is better in construction,
its character sketches are more life-like, and its literary style is
superior&mdash;therefore there is every chance of its not being so successful
with the general public.</p>

<h2>COURT NAPPING.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 25%">

<h4>Court in the Act; or, Mag-Pi-nero flying to a Wood with a
few leaves from the Gilbertum Topsyturveycum Bookum.</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wood</span> can't expect to be always the lucky possessor of a <i>Dandy
Dick</i>, nor can Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinero</span> hope always to be up to that really good
farcical standard. The good <span class="smcap">Pinero</span> has nodded over this. <i>The Cabinet
Minister</i> is an excellent title thrown away. The Cabinet Minister
himself, Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Cecil</span>, in his official costume, playing the flute,
is as burlesque as the General in full uniform, in Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert's</span>
"<i>Wedding March</i>," sitting with his feet in hot-water. The married boy
and girl, with their doll baby and irritatingly unreal quarrels,
reminded me of the boy-and-girl lovers in <i>Brantingham Hall</i>. The mother
of <i>The Macphail</i>&mdash;the wooden Scotch figure (represented by Mr. <span class="smcap">B.
Thomas</span>) still to be seen at the door of small tobacconists,&mdash;is a
Helen-Macgregorish bore, curiously suggestive of what Mr. <span class="smcap">Righton</span> might
look like in petticoats. Mrs. <span class="smcap">John Wood's</span> part is a very trying one, and
not what the public expect from her.</p>

<p>Though the piece begins fairly well, yet it is dull until Mr. <span class="smcap">Weedon
Grossmith</span>, as <i>Joseph Lebanon</i>, comes on the scene in the Second Act,
when everyone begins to be amused, and ends by being disappointed.
<i>Joseph</i> remains the hero of the situation, and, cad as he is, the
behaviour of the ladies and gentlemen towards him reduces them to his
level, so that, in spite of its being a farce, we begin to pity him as
we pity Mr. <span class="smcap">Guthrie's</span> <i>Pariah</i>, and as those who remember <span class="smcap">Theodore
Hook's</span> novel have pitied that wretched little cad, <i>Jack Brag</i>. The part
is not equal to <i>Aunt Jack's</i> Solicitor, and had Mr. <span class="smcap">Grossmith</span>, by the
kind permission of Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinero</span>, departed from the conventional Adelphi
and Drury Lane type of comic Hebraic money-lender, he would have done
better. The piece is played with the burlesque earnestness that
characterised the first performances of <i>Engaged</i> at the Haymarket,
which piece the Scotch accent recalls to the playgoer's memory. No one
can possibly feel any interest in the lovers.</p>

<p>As a rule Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinero's</span> stage-management is simple and effective: but
here the design is confused and the result is an appearance of restless
uncertainty. Drumdurris Castle seems to be a lunatic asylum, of which
the principal inmates are two elderly female patients, one, like a
twopence-coloured plate of some ancient Scotch heroine, with a craze
about Scotland, and the other mad on saying "Fal-lal," and screaming out
something about "motives." If eight of the characters were cut out,
"they'd none of 'em be missed," and if the play were compressed into one
Act, it would contain the essence of all that was worth retaining, and,
with a few songs and dances, might make an attractive <i>lever de rideau</i>
or "laughable farce to finish," before, or after, a revival of <i>Dandy
Dick</i>.</p>

<h4>The Scandinavian Composer.</h4>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday, April 22.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Bennett's</span> Libretto of <i>Thorgrim</i> good from
literary point of view; poor from dramatic ditto. Composer <span class="smcap">Cowen</span> not
possessing dramatic power sufficient for two, cannot supply the want.
Sestett and Chorus, end of Act II., skilfully worked up, and received
with acclamation. Opera, in a general way, Wagnerish. Orchestration
shows the hand of a master, Master <span class="smcap">Cowen</span>. Local colour good, but too
much local colour spoils the Opera. Mr. <span class="smcap">McGuckin</span> is <i>Thorgrim</i> to the
life; singing, acting, and make-up admirable. Miss <span class="smcap">Z&eacute;lie de Lussan</span>
highly commendable. Miss <span class="smcap">Tremelli</span>, mother of <i>Helgi</i> (an ugly name and
scarcely mentionable to ears polite), loud and leading as a
lady-villain. <i>Helgi</i> and <i>Arnora</i> are first cousins (not once removed)
to <i>Telrammond</i> the Tedious and <i>Ortrude</i> the Orful. Mr. <span class="smcap">Celli</span> as
<i>King</i>, a sort of Scandinavian <span class="smcap">Beau Brummel</span>, imparts light comedy touch
to Opera, which, but for this, might have been a trifle dull. <span class="smcap">Cowen</span>
called, came, congratulated. H. R. H. Prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, setting the best
example, as he always does, to Opera-goers, came at the beginning and
remained to the end.</p>

<p><i>April 23.</i>&mdash;<i>Maritana</i> delighted everyone. Miss <span class="smcap">Georgina Burns</span>
splendid. Mr. <span class="smcap">John Child</span>, as <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, good child. Mr. <span class="smcap">Leslie Crotty</span> good
for <i>Jos&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p><i>April 26.</i>&mdash;<i>Lohengrin.</i> <i>King</i> played by <span class="smcap">Pope</span> with considerable amount
of temporal power. <span class="smcap">F. Davies</span> good as the <i>Herald</i>, but which <i>Herald</i> he
is, whether the "Family" or "New York" not quite clear. Incidental music
by amateurs in the Gallery, who, in lengthy interval between Second and
Third Scenes of Last Act, whistled "<i>We won't go home till morning!</i>"</p>

<p>Carl Rosa Opera season soon over, then Drama at Drury Lane, and Italian
Opera at Covent Garden. <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus Operaticus
Counticouncillarius</span> (Sheriff <i>in posse</i>, Alderman <i>in futuro</i>, and Lord

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<center>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</center>

<p>The Duke of <span class="smcap">Dumpshire</span> seems to have been much annoyed by my statement
that he killed two trainers with his own hand, for being caught watching
a trial of his Derby horses, and that the Jockey Club took no action. I
beg to inform his Grace and those who approve his methods, that I care
no more for their annoyance than I do for the muddy-minded lucubrations
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> and his servile tribe of moon-calves. I have public duties
to perform, and if, in the course of my comments on racing, I should
find myself occasionally compelled to run counter to the imbecile
prejudices of some of the aristocratic patrons of the turf, I can assure
my readers that I shall not flinch from the task. I therefore repeat
that, in the middle of last month, the Duke of <span class="smcap">Dumpshire</span> killed two
trainers, and that up to the present time the Jockey Club have not
enforced against him the five-pound penalty which is specially provided
by their rules for offences of this sort. When Mr. <span class="smcap">Jacobs</span>, who has no
aristocratic connections, ventured to lynch a rascally tout on Newmarket
Heath last year, he was made to pay up at once. The contrast is
suggestive.</p>

<p>A lot of jannering nonsense has been talked about <i>Bazaar</i> by the
Will-o'-the-Wisps who mislead the long-suffering public in turf matters.
<i>Bazaar</i> is by <i>Rector</i> out of <i>Church Mouse</i>, and in his pedigree are
to be found such well-known roarers as <i>Boanerges</i> and <i>Hallelujah
Sal</i>&mdash;not much of a recommendation to anybody except Mr. <span class="smcap">Jeremy</span>. His own
performances are worse than contemptible. As a two-year old, he was
placed second at eight stone to <i>Candlestick</i> in the Warmington Open
Welter Handicap. After that he sprang a curb in the middle of his back,
and the fools who train him actually brought him out to run in the
All-aged Selling Plate at Ballymacwhacket. He won the race easily enough
of course, but only an impostor, whose head was stuffed with horsehair,
would attach the least importance to that. Since then he has eaten two
pairs of spurs, a halter, and half of a jockey, which scarcely looks
like winning races. I have now relieved my conscience on the matter, so
if the puddle-brains wish to back him, their loss must lie at their own
doors.</p>

<p>The Marquis de <span class="smcap">Millepardon</span> has bought <i>Chowbock</i> for &pound;2000. At the last
Epsom Meeting <i>Chowbock</i> showed himself a fine pace-maker in an East
wind, having cantered in from <i>Sister Mary</i>, who as good as walked round
<i>Vilikins</i> when the latter was being tried without his pastern-pad on
the Cotswold Hills. At the same time it must be remembered, that <i>Sister
Mary</i> only got home by a length from <i>Smockfrock</i>, after having been
double-girthed and provided with a bucket of <span class="smcap">Pocock's</span> antiseptic,
anti-crib-biting condition balls for internal application over the
Newmarket T. Y. C.</p>

<p>Next week, I may have something to say about Derby prospects. For the
present, I can only advise would-be investors to steer clear of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Jeremy</span> and his quacking, goose-headed parasites.</p>

<h2>HOW I WELCOMED STANLEY.</h2>

<center>(<i>Notes of a Very Important Journey.</i>)</center>

<p>Left Victoria by special train. On my road met my dear old friend <span class="smcap">Brown</span>.
We were boys together. Nothing I would not do for him. <span class="smcap">Brown</span> says the
dearest object of his life is to welcome <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. Can't I take him with
me? (This on learning the nature of <i>my</i> expedition.) He is off to
Canada to-morrow&mdash;early. More sorry than I can say&mdash;impossible. Only
invitation for "one." One, myself. He sighs and we part&mdash;it may be for
years, it may be for ever. Sorrowful, but cheered up by party in special
train. Everybody in great spirits going to welcome <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. Dearest
object of everybody's life. To pass the time tell one another stories of
adventure. Man who was in the Franco-German War explains how he would
have defended Metz if he had been <span class="smcap">Bazaine</span>. Man who went through the
Soudan (perhaps a trifle jealous), says if he <i>had</i> been <span class="smcap">Bazaine</span> he
wouldn't have defended Metz at all, because <span class="smcap">Bazaine</span> was a traitor. Row
imminent, so cut in with my adventure in a life-boat. Graphic account.
Ship springing a-leak; men at the pumps; boats given up to the women and
children. The good ship&mdash;well, never mind the name of ship; have
forgotten it&mdash;lurches, gives one long roll, and sinks! Remaining
passengers, headed by myself, swarm up the rigging to the mizzen-top.
High sea, thunder and lightning. Great privations. Sun sinks in red,
moon rises in green. All hope gone, when&mdash;hurrah, a sail! It is the
life-boat! Slung on board by ropes. Rockets and coloured lights let off.
The coxswain calls upon the crew to "pull blue," or "pull white."
Startling adventures. On the rocks! Off them! Saved! Everybody pleased
with my story. Keep to myself the fact that I have only once in my life
been on board a life-boat&mdash;when it was practising off Lynton. No more
stories after mine. Company (disheartened) break up into groups. Pleased
with the scenery. After all, there is no place like Dover&mdash;when you stop
there. Glad I am not going to welcome <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> on the other side of the
Channel. London, Chatham and Dover Railway arrangements capital,
especially when you are travelling <i>en prince</i>.</p>

<p>Ah, here we are at Dover! Meet <span class="smcap">Jones</span>&mdash;of course, he is going to welcome
<span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. So are <span class="smcap">Snooks</span> and <span class="smcap">Smith</span>. And, as I live, old <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>! Well,
this is very plucky of old <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>. Thought he was dead years ago. Says
he would not miss <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> for worlds. More would I. Great privilege to
welcome him. Feel it most deeply. The greatest explorer of the age. But
sea-air has made me a trifle hungry and thirsty. I daresay lunch is
going on somewhere. Find it isn't! Deputation of Vergers, seemingly from
Canterbury Cathedral, headed by a beadle, carrying an ear-trumpet,
forcing their way through crowd. Police arrangements the reverse of
satisfactory. Distinguished proprietor of influential newspaper
hustled&mdash;possibly mistaken for <span class="smcap">Emin Pasha</span>, who would be <i>de trop</i> on
such an occasion. But must have lunch. Not up to form of Signor <span class="smcap">Succi</span>.
So avoid the brilliant but giddy throng, and find out a favourite little
restaurant close to the Lord Warden. French <i>plats</i> and some excellent
<i>Grave</i>. Know the <i>Grave</i> of old&mdash;seldom asked for, and so kept long in
bottle. Order a nice little luncheon and feel rather sleepy. Luncheon
ready. Do it justice, and fancy suddenly that I am in charge of the lamp
in a lighthouse. Rough night. Ah! the life-boat! manned by old <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>
(adventurous chap old <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>) <span class="smcap">Snooks</span>, <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, <span class="smcap">Smith</span> and <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Thought
latter had gone to Canada! Open eyes with a start. Waiter and bill.
Bless me, how late it is. Must be off at once to welcome <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. Meet
old <span class="smcap">Tompkins</span>, <span class="smcap">Snooks</span>, <span class="smcap">Jones</span> and <span class="smcap">Smith</span> instead. They tell me that they
have all welcomed <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. Found him being "run into" the train by two
policemen! Thought him looking very well. Didn't I? Ask, where is he
now? Don't I know? Why gone back by the special! Thought I must have
missed it on purpose. Hurry away in bad temper. May catch him up. Pop
into fast train just starting. Scenery bad. Weather horrid. Fellow
travellers unsupportable. Ah, here we are at last at Victoria. One
satisfaction&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brown</span> didn't welcome him either. Why here <i>is</i> <span class="smcap">Brown</span> on
the platform&mdash;do him a last good turn&mdash;describe <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. I tell him that
the great explorer looks younger than ever, wears big cap, white suit,
revolver and field-glasses. Every inch a portrait in the <i>Daily
Graphic</i>! <span class="smcap">Brown</span> says, "That's strange, as he didn't look like <i>that</i>
when <i>he</i> saw him!" Appears <span class="smcap">Brown</span> put off trip to Canada to welcome him.
Can't be helped! Shall meet <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> somewhere (movements advertised
daily in the <i>Times</i>) and when I <i>do</i> won't I give him a bit of my mind,
for not waiting long enough to let me welcome him!</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<center>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</center>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 21.</i>&mdash;House really beginning to fill
up. <span class="smcap">Hartington</span> back from the Riviera. First time he has appeared this
Session; lounged in with pretty air of having been there yesterday and
just looked in again. Blushed with surprise to find Members on both
sides welcoming him with cheer.</p>

<p>"We all like <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>," said <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>. "Of course we
liked him better when he agreed with our opinions; but we can't all keep
straight, and he's gone wrong. Still, we bear him no malice. Sorry he
was ill; glad he's better. Must encourage this benevolent attitude
towards him, since it enables us, with fuller vigour to denounce
<span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>. You see, when we howl at <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>, they can't say we are
simply moved by personal spite, because here we are cheering <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>
as he returns to the fray."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Dillon</span> back too; bronzed with Australian suns; ruddy with the
breezes of lusty Colorado. Everyone glad to see <span class="smcap">John</span> back; first because
everyone likes him; next for reasons akin to those which the <span class="smcap">Sage</span>
frankly acknowledges when cheering <span class="smcap">Hartington</span>. Even in the evil days
when <span class="smcap">John Dillon</span> used to fold his arms and flash dark glances of
defiance on Speaker <span class="smcap">Brand</span>, House didn't include him in same angry,
uncompromising, denunciation as hurtled round head of <span class="smcap">William O'Brien</span>,
<span class="smcap">Tim Healy</span>, and dear old <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>. <span class="smcap">John Dillon</span> sometimes suspended;
occasionally sent to prison; but the honesty of his motives, the purity
of his patriotism, always acknowledged. Mistaken, led astray (that is to
say differed from us on matters of opinion), but meant well.</p>

<h4>The Sage.</h4>
</div>

<p>"Yes, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said the <span class="smcap">Sage</span>, lighting another cigarette; "always well
when you're going it hot for a Party to have some individual in it whom
you can omit from general implication of infamous motives. Gives one
high moral standpoint, doncha know. Thus, when I want to suggest that
<span class="smcap">the Markiss</span> is a mere tool in hands of <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span>, I extol honest purposes
of <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>; hint, you know, that he is not so sharp of perception
as he might be; but that gives him the fuller claim upon our sympathy,
seeing that he is yoked with a colleague of the natural depravity, and
capable of the infinite iniquity, which marks the <span class="smcap">Markiss's</span> relations
with public affairs. The great thing, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, in public controversy
is to assume an attitude of impartiality. When you have to suggest that
a political adversary was privy to the putting-away of his grandmother,
do it rather in sorrow than in anger, and if you can find or make an
opportunity of saying at the same time a kind word for one of his
colleagues, seize it. That's why we cheer <span class="smcap">Hartington</span> to-night, and why
the Tories sometimes admit that <span class="smcap">John Dillon's</span> an honest man."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<i>Parnell</i> moved rejection of Land Purchase Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Courtney</span> on in his famous quick-change scene. One minute he
is discovered in recesses of canopied chair as Speaker; the next is
seated at table as Chairman of Committees. <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, everyone sorry to
learn, is ill in bed. So <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> doubles his part. Proceeding watched
with profound interest from Strangers' Gallery. At ten minutes and ten
seconds to Seven House in Committee of Supply. <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> in Chair at
table; Mace off the table; <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> on his legs. As hand of clock falters
over the numeral ten, <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> gets up, says never a word, wheels to
right out of Chair and marches to rear. <span class="smcap">Tanner</span> stops midway in sentence
and resumes seat. Sergeant-at-Arms bowing thrice advances, lifts Mace on
to table, and retires. Stranger in Gallery wondering what has become of
<span class="smcap">Courtney</span>, appalled by discovering him in <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> Chair, quite a new
man. On these occasions marks his swiftly varying condition by altered
tone of voice. As Chairman of Committees, assumes piping treble voice,
as Deputy-Chairman drops occasional observations in profound bass.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 20%">

<h4>Sergeant-at-Arms (and Legs).</h4>
</div>

<p>"Only thing left to me, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," he said, when I congratulated him on
his treble. "Haven't time to change dress, even if it were permissible;
must do something to mark wide gulf fixed between Chairman of Committee
and <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>; so hit upon this scheme. Glad you like the treble; a little
out of my line, but practice makes perfect."</p>

<p>At Evening Sitting question of Labour and Capital brought on by <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>.
<span class="smcap">Cunninghame-Graham</span> let House see what a terrible fellow he is. Doesn't
look the part; but after speech to-night no question of his innate
ferocity. <i>Sim Tappertit</i> not in it for such blood-curdling remarks. "I
have," he said just now, "often interfered between Capital and Labour;
but, thank Heaven! I have never interfered in the character of a
conciliator."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" he cried, a little later, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of nothing. "You talk of
inciting to violence. I have never incited to violence, and wherefore?
Because, in present state of affairs, with society a vast organised
conspiracy, violence would recoil on the heads of the Working Classes.
But, Sir, the time will come when things will be otherwise, and the very
moment that power is in the hands of the Working Classes I shall incite
them to violence."</p>

<p>After this House took early opportunity of adjourning. Pretty to see
Members stealing across Palace Yard in the dark, looking furtively right
and left, not sure that moment was not come, and <span class="smcap">Simon Cunninghame
Tappertit Graham</span> was not hounding on his "United Bulldogs" against the
Classes. "We must look out, <span class="smcap">Broadhurst</span>," said <span class="smcap">James Rowlands</span>, nervously
rubbing his hand. "It's all very well of your retiring to Cromer. I
think I shall practise with a revolver; shall certainly carry a
sword-stick."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Resolutions through Committee.</p>

<p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> came down to-day in unusually good
spirits. Nothing happened of late to give enemy occasion to blaspheme.
Crewe affair seems quite forgotten; nobody going to be hanged when he
ought to be reprieved, or reprieved when he ought to be hanged. Seems
almost as if, after all, life for <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> would be worth living.
Whatever embarrassments ahead belong to other Departments of Ministry.
Land Purchase troubles, not the <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>, nor Bi-Metallism either.
<span class="smcap">Raikes</span> been doing something at the Post Office. <span class="smcap">Goschen</span> been tampering
with tea, and sinning in the matter of currants. Something wrong with
the Newfoundland Fisheries, but that <span class="smcap">Fergusson's</span> look-out. True, <span class="smcap">Elcho</span>
wanting to know about some prisoners taken from Ipswich to Bury in
chains. Sounds bad sort of thing; sure to be letters in newspapers about
it. But <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> able to lay hand on heart and swear the chains
were light. <span class="smcap">Elcho</span> blustered a bit. Irish Members, naturally interested
in arrangements for going to prison, threateningly cheered; but after
what <span class="smcap">Matthews</span> had suffered in other times this affair lighter than the
chains themselves.</p>

<p>Incident had passed; questions on paper disposed of; soon be debating
Land Purchase Bill; all would be well for at least another day. Suddenly
up gets <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>; wants to know who is responsible for the design of new
police buildings on Thames Embankment? Flush of pride mantles brow of
<span class="smcap">Matthews</span>. This red-hot building&mdash;its gables, its roofs, its windows, its
doorways, and its twisted knockers&mdash;was designed under his direction. It
is his dower to London, set forth on one of its most spacious sites.
What does <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> want to know about it? Why is <span class="smcap">Plunket</span> so studious in
repudiating all responsibility for the thing? Wherefore does crowded
House cheer and laugh when <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> gives notice to call attention to
building on Home Office Vote? Can it be possible that here is another
mistake? Ought he to have hanged the architect instead of encouraging
him? Always doing things for the best, and they turn out the very worst.
Been occasionally misunderstood; but did, at least, think that London
would be grateful for this emanation from the heated architectural mind.</p>

<p>"Looks so like a carbuncle suddenly developed on Embankment, with the
stately Thames swirling below, that I really thought they would like
it," said <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>, mopping his furrowed brow. "But there are some
people, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, who are never pleased, and prominent among them are the
people of London."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Land Purchase Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Things rather in a muddle to-day all round. At Morning
Sitting didn't get Supply which everybody expected would be order of
day; didn't proceed with Allotments Bill, which was first on Orders. At
night, <span class="smcap">Provand</span> on first with Dried Currants; <span class="smcap">McLaren</span> to follow with
Woman's Suffrage, neither turned up, and at half-past eleven by dint of
Closure, got into Committee of Supply. <span class="smcap">George Campbell</span> cruising up and
down in New Guinea steamer; finally docked. Then <span class="smcap">Arthur Williams</span> moved
to report progress; more discussion; <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> pounced; Division on
Closure; <span class="smcap">Courtney</span> named <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span> as one of tellers; <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span> in Limerick;
House couldn't wait for him to return; so <span class="smcap">Waddy</span> brought out of Lobby to
tell with <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>. When Closure carried, it was ten minutes past one.
House bound to rise at one o'clock; Chairman equally bound to put the
question, which was to report progress. Motion for progress negatived,
which meant that the House would go on with business; but it being a
quarter past one Deputy-Speaker must needs leave Chair, and so sitting
collapsed.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>, "this is hard to understand. Must go off to the
Garrick and think it over."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>
